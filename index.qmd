I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu/).

During **2021-2024**, I worked as a postdoc at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/) with [David Dunson](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dunson), developing methods for robust Bayesian inference and clustering.

During **2016-2021**, I obtained a PhD in Statistics and Operations Research from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://stor.unc.edu/), under the direction of [Shankar Bhamidi](https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/), [Amarjit Budhiraja](https://abudhiraja.web.unc.edu/) in Queuing theory and [Andrew Nobel](https://nobel.web.unc.edu/) on application of multiple-testing and correlation mining to problems in genomics like eQTL analysis.
